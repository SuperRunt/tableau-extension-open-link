# Examsoft Question Extension
Here's a first stab... I'm not 100% sure this is a useful extension, since the user has to login and that is kind of a cluster. 

## Getting Started
* clone this repo
* install dependencies```npm install```
* start local server to host the extensions ```node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server -p 8765```

## Install the extension
* add the extension object to the dashboard 
* choose 'My Extensions' in the pop up 
* select the manifest.trex file in this project
